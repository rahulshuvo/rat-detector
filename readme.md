The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer that is perfect for running the YOLOv5 algorithm, which is able to quickly and accurately detect rats in video footage. By using a low-cost solution like the Raspberry Pi, we are able to bring this technology to a wider range of users, including pest control professionals, researchers, and even homeowners.



The YOLOv5 algorithm is one of the version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. It is able to detect objects in real-time and with a high level of accuracy. This makes it perfect for tracking rat populations in a variety of environments, from urban to rural.
